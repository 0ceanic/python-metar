========================================================================
The metar library
========================================================================

Metar is a python package for interpreting METAR and SPECI coded
weather reports.  

METAR and SPECI are coded aviation weather reports.  The official
coding schemes are specified in the World Meteorological Organization
(WMO) Manual on Codes, vol I.1, Part A (WMO-306 I.i.A).  US conventions
for METAR/SPECI reports vary in a number of ways from the international
standard, and are described in chapter 12 of the Federal Meteorological
Handbook No.1. (FMH-1 1995), issued by NOAA.  The metar library
should be able to decode reports that follow either the strict WMO
spec or the US conventions. 

Current and historical METAR data can be obtained from various places.
The current METAR report for a given airport is available at the URL
http://weather.noaa.gov/pub/data/observations/metar/stations/<station>.TXT
where <station> is the four-letter ICAO airport station code.  The 
accompanying script get_report.py will download and decode the
current report for any specified station.  

The METAR reports for all reporting stations for any "cycle" (i.e., hour) 
in the last 24 hours is available in a single file at the URL
http://weather.noaa.gov/pub/data/observations/metar/cycles/<cycle>Z.TXT
where <cycle> is a 2-digit cycle number (e.g., "00", "05" or "23").  

The WMO and US code specifications are available online as PDF
files, but I don't have URL's for them.  I'll be happy to mail
copies to anyone who'd like them.

Installation
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Install this package in the usual way,

    python setup.py install

There's a small, inadequate test suite that can be run by saying

    python test/all_tests.py

There are a couple of sample scripts, described briefly below.

There's no real documentation to speak of, yet, but feel free to
contact me with any questions you might have about how to use this package.

Contents
------------------------------------------------------------------------

README  ............... this file

parse_metar.py  ....... a simple commandline driver for the METAR parser

get_report.py ......... a script to download and decode the current reports
                        for one or more stations.

sample.py  ............ a simple script showing how the decoded data 
                        can be accessed. (see metar/*.py sources and the
                        test/test_*.py scripts for more examples.)

metar/
    Metar.py  ......... the implementation of the Metar class.  This class
                        parses and represents a single METAR report.

    Datatypes.py  ..... a support module that defines classes representing 
                        different types of meteorological data, including
                        temperature, pressure, speed, distance, direction 
                        and position.
                        
test/
    all_tests.py  ..... a master test driver, which invokes all of the unit tests

    test_*.py  ........ individual test modules

setup.py  ............. installation script
